# Chained-Mesa
Manifest Roguelite


Premise:

- Cornelius Ryan is having his debtors work on the chain rail in Fallen Mesa.
- The game involves moving the base camp by expanding the railroad.
- Multiple routes going forward or back for different reasons.
- Each leg of the track you unlock pays a portion of your ledger, but being called back charges you, instead.

Main Character:

- Mugwump? Duskmott? Seems like a good fit for them.
- Main Character is chained at the ankle, allowing Ryan to pull him back to the base camp.


Weapons:

- Ten blade
- Sixer
- Aegis Wheel


Non-Player Characters:

- A dealer who lets you gamble for additional health or strength.
- A representative from Fargo who lets you churn up a biome.
- Filomena - Summon the House of the Western Star.

Resources:

- Tense-iron
- Rust-water?
- Legendary plantlife or animals
- Ostarq?
- 


Story:

- It seems like Ryan should be the villain or at least a sub-villain. The ledger seems like that sort of mechanic.
- Building out the train track and getting free of Ryan's ledger should be the main goal of the game.
- Sounds like debt is a major theme, so maybe dealing with old mistakes or the conflict between those in power and those without. I think I have more to say about the battle between the rich and the poor right now and the crazy need for the poor to be indebted to the rich.
- I would like a story of paying off the ledger while looking for ways to subtly undermine Ryan.
- How would the main character do that? If the train won't go out there, Ryan will know.
