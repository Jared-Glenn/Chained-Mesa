# Chained-Mesa
Manifest Roguelite


Premise:

- Cornelius Ryan is having his debtors work on the chain rail in Fallen Mesa.
- The game involves moving the base camp by expanding the railroad.
- Multiple routes going forward or back for different reasons.
- Each leg of the track you unlock pays a portion of your ledger, but being called back charges you, instead.

Main Character:

- Duskmott
- Main Character is chained at the ankle, allowing Ryan to pull him back to the base camp.
- Maybe the chain itself is a mechanic that can trip or harm enemies.
- Outsider perspective on kechin and Fallen Mesa.
- Way to explore the central themes of exploitation between duskmotts and the host kings.
- More distinctive figure.
- Could do floating/gliding moves.
- A 2.5D type of Roguelite, maybe. Elevation could play a role.
- How would that work with melee and range? Seems like it would be easy for the player to exploit.




Weapons:

- Ten blade: Unload a blade after a crit like a ranged weapon. Kind of a crit-fishing weapon.
- Sixer: Ranged weapon that can shoot many times, becoming less accurate until you "reload."
- Aegis Wheel
- War Pan


Non-Player Characters:

- A dealer who lets you gamble for additional health or strength.
- A representative from Fargo who lets you churn up a biome.
- Filomena - Summon the House of the Western Star.
- Splinter Church building where you can get blessings from different paragons.
- Esmund Appletree: Healing and growth.
- Gideon Splints: Damage and wounds.
- Ruth Coil: Spider minions and binding in place.

Rex Oztineka
- Wudrigar missionary from the Coylina Mission.
- Helps MC, but doesn't remember him. They were friends a long time ago, but the wudrigar memory is lost to time.

Resources:

- Tense-iron
- Rust-water?
- Legendary plantlife or animals
- Ostarq?
- Dibel (Middle Spike jewel)


Story:

- It seems like Ryan should be the villain or at least a sub-villain. The ledger seems like that sort of mechanic.
- Building out the train track and getting free of Ryan's ledger should be the main goal of the game.
- Sounds like debt is a major theme, so maybe dealing with old mistakes or the conflict between those in power and those without. I think I have more to say about the battle between the rich and the poor right now and the crazy need for the poor to be indebted to the rich.
- I would like a story of paying off the ledger while looking for ways to subtly undermine Ryan.
- How would the main character do that? If the train won't go out there, Ryan will know.
- There must be other tasks that Ryan needs done too. Maybe he completes those instead and sabotages the rail?
- Maybe the MC also works for an opposing force, helping them against Ryan even as he does Ryan's chores.
- They could approach him during his work for Ryan, starting as enemies and becoming allies.
- How do we confront Ryan? Should we? Paying the debt off is kinda what he wants, so does paying it off feel satisfying?
- Maybe never paying it off, but slowing him down is the answer. Kind of like in Hades, the adventure never ends.
- Maybe the MC needs to split their time between different things. They can clear monsters, defend the builders, or sabotage Ryan's stake in the rail. Maybe ensuring that it goes to the workers.
- Making these into different types of work can give it a Stardew Valley feel to it while keeping the Roguelite method.



Old Notes:
- Mugwump? Duskmott? Seems like a good fit for them.
- 
Mugwump MC

Pros
- Outsider perspective on duskmott society.
- Way to explore racial tensions between duskmotts and mugwumps pushing into their territory.

Cons
- Mugwumps aren't super distinct from above.

Duskmott MC

Pros
- Outsider perspective on kechin and Fallen Mesa.
- Way to explore the central themes of exploitation between duskmotts and the host kings.
- More distinctive figure.
- Could do floating/gliding moves.

Cons
- Might come across as more fairy than moth.
